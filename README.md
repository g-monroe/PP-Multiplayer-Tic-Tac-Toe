# PP-Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe
Uses PHP and MySql to overall session the games and create temp users that can play around the world with each other. This project also used AJAX to update the Front-End so the user would see the other players turn and the score.

# Thank you
This project was just for fun and I had a fun time making it. Overall it was a simplistic idea.
